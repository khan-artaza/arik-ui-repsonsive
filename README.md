## 🖼️ Overview

**Arik UI** is a fully responsive modern user interface layout built using **HTML** and **SCSS (SASS)**. The design is minimal and clean, making it ideal for learning, practicing UI layout techniques, or using as a starter template for web projects.

> 🎓 This project was created as part of my learning journey to master **SCSS** and implement a **mobile-first responsive design** approach.
